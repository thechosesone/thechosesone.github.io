        <h3 class="article__titleblock">PANA takes care of you<span></span></h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">PANA provides attention during situations of risk, imagine your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere ¿who do you call?</p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">It´s an interesting premise but many rules are implied when pricing an communicating the scope of the service, specially in Caracas, a city with a high crime rate and an infinite variety of risk levels to cover (which is precisely what makes us valuable).</p>
        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">Our nature is similar to those of insurance companies, and we bought that reference into the table when trying to understand how people negotiate safety as a product. Insurance models are crammed with clauses and conditions, which often stalls the acquisition process because the pain of understanding it beats the joy of finally having it.</p>
        <h3 class="article__titleblock">Responsive copywriting<span></span></h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">We understood that narrative was key and that impact precedes detail, so we developed pieces of writing that shrank or grew depending on the format of delivery and used figma to put it together as a guideline catalog.</p>
        <img src="assets/panaweb_01.png" alt="Responsive copywriting" class="project__cover-image">
        <h3 class="article__titleblock">The User<span></span></h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">From the data recovered from customer archives and qualitatuve research, we found out two important things: first, many want to acquire PANA for someone else, mainly mothers looking out for their family. Specially in foreign countries, there´s a strong motivation to help and feel close to their relatives in Venezuela.</p>
        <img src="assets/users.png" alt="The user" class="project__cover-image">
        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">Therefore, we focused on safety as a gift and developed a purchasing experience that allowed multiple payment methods and currencies, tailored specially for "the user that wants to give". Those who want PANA for themselves have acces to a freemium app that let´s you test the service and then provides you with the acquisition channels without leaving your <a href="#">See the PANA App project</a></p>
        <h2 class="article__mainphrase">I´m interested, but I´ll do it later</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">We had a good amount of data stating that customers download the PANA app, but don´t end up completing the onboarding process. As we designed a sales funnel, we tought of delivering a user interface with as less noise as posible.</p>
        <h3 class="article__titleblock">The Strategy<span></span></h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">There were two main objectives: first, advertise our services and show the way it´s packaged as a yearly suscription, second, build "gift-giving" as a main feature.</p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">A UI concept was developed where a series of "cards" that cover each other up as you go through the payment process and other user flows. This allows us to focus the attention of the user on a few current elements without "erasing" your progress from the screen</p>
