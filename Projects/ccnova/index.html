            This one's a particular project. Since I'm the client. My family owns a small commercial building in Porlamar and I took
            the task of figuring out how to advertise it and position it digitally.
        </p>

        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">
            without any prior knowledge, we started with a minimal-effort essay on how to put ourselves "out there". This involved being
            present on the web, social media, and also Pyisical space.

            We made a list of questions that would arise in the common client's mind and played the situation in our heads many times until
            we figured out a copywriting narrative that left no holes open.
        </p>

        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">
            The decision was to recreate what people would type in a search engine (I know, basic SEO). But making it fit into
            compelling pieces of text.

            We had the CAD drawings for floor plans and elevations. If we showcased them in a simple manner, they would provide
            meaningful information to the user at a single glance. (floor area, maximum measurements, height,  facade openings etc).
            so I turned them all into blue and white SVGS and integrated that graphic language into the general visual brand.

        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">
            Since most of the client acquisition work was to be made locally, the website needed to be just a place for
            validation an legitimacy. We focused on creating a one-screen setup that allowed for a quick consultation.

            This website was made in a week. We had already approved a Budget for printing large "FOR RENT" signs and we hand
            a very close deadline if we wanted to print the site's URL.

        <p class="article__paragraph articlespace">
            Webflow did the trick. Interestingly enough, the site is not hosted in webflow. Which is known to have high hosting
            fees. Instead, I managed to work around the program's limitations and exported the site to netlify, which reduced
            the original cost down to 10%. That's a very viable business template for small static landing pages.
